Urojex is a simple and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build without ever leaving your HTML.
- **Time saving**: Urojex makes it easier to design web your website by creating template for components by Javascript, so you will spend less time writing CSS :alarm_clock:
- **Customizable**: Components can be changed in **color**, **size**, ... to fit your website :man_technologist:
- **Too simple to get started!**: Just paste a CDN link into your HTML file and you can start using UROJEX!!! :exploding_head:

## Installation
Here is some way to get started with UROJEX:
- [Downloading source code to use offline](https://github.com/urojex/urojex/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
- Use CDN at [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/urojex/urojex).
- Fast start by package manager (comming soon).

Addition assets
- Font: [CDN right here at jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/urojex/urojex@0.0.1-beta/font/stylesheet.min.css) :)
- Examples file: [Get code at jsDelivr too](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/urojex/urojex@0.0.1-beta/test/index.html)

## Documentations
You can find Urojex documentations [on the website]().

## Example
We have some examples [on the website]() or in [the test file](https://github.com/urojex/urojex/blob/master/test/index.html), this is one for you to get started:
```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/urojex/urojex@latest/font/stylesheet.min.css">
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/urojex/urojex@latest/src/urojex.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <text size="32" color="#f00">First website with Urojex!!!</text>
  </body>
</html>
```
This example will render "First website with Urojex!!!" into a container on the page.

you'll notice we use unusual HTML element names, and you can change the style of component by putting value in attributes, so you won't write too much CSS, just stay with your HTML file.

## Font
You can use Apple system font at [our CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/urojex/urojex@latest/font/).

Put this in your `<head>`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/urojex/urojex@latest/font/stylesheet.min.css">
```
Source of the font is SF Pro, you can download it for other purpose at [Apple Font page](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/).
